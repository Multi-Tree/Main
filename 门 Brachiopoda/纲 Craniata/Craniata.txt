Craniata （Williams, Carlson, Brunton, Holmer & Popov, 1996）
中文名：头壳纲

Craniata is a class of brachiopods originating in the Cambrian period and still extant today.[1] They have calcitic inarticulated shells that are subcircular in outline. This class of brachiopods has an unsupported lophophore and is always attached to a hard substrate in the fossil record. This hard substrate is usually another brachiopod. The plicae from the host brachiopod will then appear within the shell of the craniata.
