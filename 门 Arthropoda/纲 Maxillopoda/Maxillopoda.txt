Maxillopoda（Dahl, 1956）
中文名：颚足纲
|
Maxillopoda is a diverse class of crustaceans including barnacles, copepods and a number of related animals. It does not appear to be a monophyletic group, and no single character unites all the members.

With the exception of some barnacles, maxillopodans are mostly small,[3] including the smallest known arthropod, Stygotantulus stocki.[2] They often have short bodies, with the abdomen reduced in size, and generally lacking any appendages.[3] This may have arisen through paedomorphosis.[3]

Apart from barnacles, which use their legs for filter feeding, most maxillopodans feed with their maxillae. They have a bauplan comprising 5 cephalic segments, 6 thoracic segments and 4 abdominal segments, followed by a telson.
