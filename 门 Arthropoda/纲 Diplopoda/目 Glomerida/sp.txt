The underside of G. marginata – note the two pairs of legs per body segment
Glomeris marginata grows up to 20 millimetres (0.8 in) long and 8 mm (0.3 in) wide, and is covered by twelve black dorsal plates with white rims. [5] [6] Each segment except those at the front and back bears two pairs of legs, with around 18 pairs in total. [5] This distinguishes pill millipedes from pill woodlice, both of which are called "pillbugs" — woodlice have 7 pairs of walking legs , one per body segment, while millipedes have more pairs, and with two pairs to each apparent body segment.

When rolled into a ball, G. marginata can be distinguished from a rolled–up pill woodlouse by the asymmetrical ball it rolls into; pill woodlice roll into much more perfect spheres. [7] The cuticle is also darker and shinier, and the antennae are shorter. [8] The head and tail of a woodlouse have a greater number of small plates, while the head of Glomeris is protected by a single large shield, and it lacks the uropods of woodlice at the read end. [5] Although usually black, red, yellow and brown individuals do occasionally occur. [2]

Ecology
G. marginata just beginning to unroll from its defensive posture
Glomeris marginata lives in leaf litter as well as in grass and under stones, with a preference for calcareous soils. [2] In domestic gardens, they are most frequent along hedgerows and at the bases of old walls, where the mortar has started to crumble, leaching lime into the soil. [5] [8] It is less prone to desiccation than other millipedes and can be found in the open, even in sunny weather, [6] although they are more active at night and prefer more humid areas. [2] G. marginata feeds on old, rotting leaves, despite the higher nutrient content of freshly–fallen leaves, and G. marginata can be responsible for recycling a significant proportion of the nutrients in the leaf litter. [9]

Predators of Glomeris marginata are reported to include the starling , the common toad , the woodlouse spider , [8] and hedgehogs . [6] As well as rolling up into a ball for protection, G. marginata produces noxious chemicals to ward off potential predators, as many millipedes do. One to eight drops of a viscid fluid are secreted, containing the quinazolinone alkaloids glomerin and homoglomerin , dissolved in a watery protein matrix. [10] These chemicals act as antifeedants and toxins to spiders , insects and vertebrates , and the fluid is sticky enough to entrap the legs of ants . [10] Having completely discharged these chemical defences, it can take up to four months for the millipede to replenish their supplies. [10]

Reproduction and life cycle Edit
Breeding takes place cyclically in spring and summer. Male G. marginata are capable of producing a pheromone which attracts females, although this is only believed to be effective over short distances. [11] They then transfer sperm to the female using their gonopods , specially modified legs. After fertilisation , the females lay 70–80 eggs, each about 1 mm long, and each wrapped singly in a capsule of digested earth. [2] The eggs hatch after a period of about two months, with the duration depending on factors including temperature . [6] Development lasts for up to three years, and involves nine moults , following which moults occur periodically as adults. [2] Females are fertile for several years, and can produce six broods over their lifetime, [6] which can be up to eleven years. [2]
