N. bipes is orange or yellowish green and about one centimetre long. 
It has a loosely attached thin shell composed of two halves joined longitudinally which protect most of the segments. 
The upper pair of antennae are stumpy and branched while the lower pair are much longer, especially in the male where they can be as long as the body. 
The eyes are red and on stalks and there is a rostral spine projecting forward between them. 
There are eight pairs of appendages concealed under the shell and four longer pairs of abdominal appendages half concealed. 
The tail continues with two further pairs of stubby appendages and ends in a fork.
