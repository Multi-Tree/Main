Molpadiida is an order of sea cucumbers . The body shape is fusiform and unlike other sea cucumbers, their hind body is narrowed to form a distinct tail. Although they possess tentacles around the mouth derived from the water vascular system , they have no true tube feet , and are therefore believed to be related to the Apodida .
