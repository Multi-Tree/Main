Fanray
|
The fanray (Platyrhina sinensis) is a species of ray in the family Platyrhinidae that lives in the western Pacific Ocean. It typically grows to a length of 30–50 centimetres (12–20 in) and a weight of 200–500 grams (7.1–17.6 oz), with a brown upperside and a white underside. It eats fish and crustaceans and has poor mobility. Males live to age five and females to age twelve, with both sexes maturing between two and five years. The species is found in China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, and possibly Indonesia, in waters shallower than 100 metres (330 ft). It is probable that its population is declining due to being caught as a bycatch.
