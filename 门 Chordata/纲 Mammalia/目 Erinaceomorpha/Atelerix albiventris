Atelerix albiventris
|
The four-toed hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris), is a species of hedgehog found throughout much of central and eastern Africa.

Populations tend to be scattered between suitable savannah or cropland habitats, avoiding forested areas. The species common name is derived from the number of toes found on its hind feet. Due to its extensive range and stable wild population, the species is rated as least concern by the IUCN. There are no universally agreed subspecies of A. albiventris.
