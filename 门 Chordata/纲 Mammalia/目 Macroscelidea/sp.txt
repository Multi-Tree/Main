The western rock elephant shrew or western rock sengi (Elephantulus rupestris) is a species of elephant shrew in the family Macroscelididae. It is found in Namibia, South Africa, possibly Angola, and possibly Botswana. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry shrubland and rocky areas.[2]

Smaller members of western rock elephant shrew possess functional brown adipose tissue, which changes in thermogenic capacity depending on the season. [3]
