Dermogenys collettei
|
Dermogenys collettei is a species of viviparous halfbeak found in freshwater areas in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.[2] This species was described in 2001 by Amy Downing Meisner with the type locality given as Kuching in Sarawak.[3] The specific name honours the American ichthyologist Bruce Baden Collette.[4]

Dermogenys collettei have been shown[5] to exhibit shoaling behavior. However, contrary to predictions, they exhibited this behavior in low predation scenarios, forest stream habitats in low predation, and more open stream habitats[5]. They did not exhibit shoaling when faced with immediate predation risk[5]. Their behavior suggests that adaptive responses to immediate predation risk are absent.
