†Bolosaurus rapidens
|
The first Bolosaurus was described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1878. His article "Descriptions of Extinct Batrachia and Reptilia from the Permian Formation of Texas" mentioned the findings of crushed skull and few vertebrae of Bolosaurus striatus and Bolosaurus rapidens (Cope 1878). The imperfect skull of Bolosaurus major was found by Robert Broom in 1911 and was published in his article "On the structure and Affinities of Bolosaurus" in 1913 (Broom 1913). In 1974 a bolosaurid maxilla was found by Tartarinov in Mylva River, Komi, Russia and was named Bolosaurus traati (Tartarinov 1974). The most recent Bolosaurus species to have been discovered was by Robert R. Reisz, who found the jawbones of Bolosaurus grandis and published it in 2002 (Reisz 2002).
