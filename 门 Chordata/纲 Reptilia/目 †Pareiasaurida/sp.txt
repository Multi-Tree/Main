Pareiasaurus is an extinct genus of anapsid reptile from the Permian period. It was a typical member of its family, the pareiasaurs, which take their name from this genus.

Fossils have been found in the Beaufort Group.

Pareiasaurus is a large quadruped, about 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) long, with elephantine legs, walking in a typically reptilian posture. The skull is broad and the snout short. Its skull had several spine- and wart-like protrusions. Pareiasaurus's leaf-shaped teeth, ideal for biting through tough plant fibers, indicate it was a herbivore. Even the palate had teeth.

P. serridens (Owen, 1876) is from the Dicynodon Zone, Karoo basin, South Africa. This species was the type species for Pareiasuchus. This late species is the type species for Pareiasaurus, and represents the culmination of this lineage. The armour is well developed. There are 14 pairs of teeth, each with 9 to 11 cusps. The short deep skull is about 40 cm in length. Note the extended quadrato-jugal region (cheek bones).
