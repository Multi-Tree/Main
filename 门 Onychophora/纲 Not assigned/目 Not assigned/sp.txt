Unlike other velvet worms, Eoperipatus totoro has uniquely shaped hairs on its body surface. 
The body length is up to 60 millimetres (2.4 in). 
These worms spend most of their lives inside moist soil, in rotting logs or under rocks. 
They come out only during rainy season, and therefore, are not easily seen. They can spit out jets of sticky glue, by which they capture small prey for food.
They eject a net of glue from two appendages on their back. The glue is composed of a mixture of proteins in which prey can be entangled.
Diagnostic features include distinct types of scales on the ventral side of the body, the inner structure of the circular pits on the male genital pad, and the position and size of the anal gland pads in males
