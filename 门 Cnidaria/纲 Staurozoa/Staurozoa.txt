Staurozoa is a class of Medusozoa, jellyfishes and hydrozoans. It has one extant order: Stauromedusae (stalked jellyfishes). A fossil group called Conulariida has been proposed as a second order,[2] although this is highly speculative. The extinct order is largely unknown and described as a possibly cnidarian clade of marine life with shell-like structures, the Conulariida. Staurozoans are small animals (1–4 cm or 0.4–1.6 in) that live in marine environments, usually attached to seaweeds, rocks, or gravel.[3] They have a large antitropical distribution, a majority found in boreal or polar, near-shore, and shallow waters. Few staurozoans are found in warmer tropical and subtropical water environments of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean basins, but most are known from the Northern Hemisphere.[3] Over the years their number of species has increased, thus right now it is said to have an estimated 50 species.[4
