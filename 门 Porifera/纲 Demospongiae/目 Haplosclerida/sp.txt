A thinly encrusting sponge with a thickness of around 4 mm (Fig 2I) and a maximum observed diameter of 40 cm. Oscular chimneys were present on some specimens. These had the form of small cones around 6 mm in diameter with an elevation of around 8 mm. Oscules were 2–5 mm in diameter. Oscular chimneys were observed mainly in the specimens in the mangrove roots (Fig 2A–2D).

Surface uneven.Compressible, very soft and fragile, easily damaged.Most living specimens are a vivid maroon colour (Fig 2A, 2B and 2D). However, those living in stressful situations, such as intertidal specimens in summer conditions, may bleach to a pale yellow (Fig 2C). In alcohol specimens are pale yellow.
