Phoronida (Hatschek, 1888）
中文名：帚虫动物门

Most adult phoronids are 2 to 20 cm long and about 1.5 mm wide, [9] although the largest are 50 cm long.[14] Their skins have no cuticle but secrete rigid tubes of chitin,[9] similar to the material used in arthropods' exoskeletons,[15] and sometimes reinforced with sediment particles and other debris.[1] Most species' tubes are erect, but those of Phoronis vancouverensis are horizontal and tangled.[16] Phoronids can move within their tubes but never leave them.[9] The bottom end of the body is an ampulla (a flask-like swelling in a tube-like structure[17]),[9] which anchors the animal in the tube and enables it to retract its body when threatened,[14] reducing the body to 20 percent of its maximum length.[1] Longitudinal muscles retract the body very quickly, while circular muscles slowly extend the body by compressing the internal fluid.[14]

For feeding and respiration each phoronid has at the top end a lophophore, a "crown" of tentacles with which the animal filter-feeds. In small species the "crown" is a simple circle, in medium-size species it is bent into the shape of a horseshoe with tentacles on the outer and inner sides, and in the largest species the ends of the horseshoe wind into complex spirals. These more elaborate shapes increase the area available for feeding and respiration.[9] The tentacles are hollow, held upright by fluid pressure, and can be moved individually by muscles.[14]

The mouth is inside the base of the crown of tentacles but to one side. The gut runs from the mouth to one side of the stomach, in the bottom of the ampulla. The intestine runs from the stomach, up the other side the body, and exits at the anus, outside and a little below the crown of tentacles. The gut and intestine are both supported by two mesenteries (partitions that run the length of the body) connected to the body wall, and another mesentery connects the gut to the intestine.[9]

The body is divided into coeloms,[9] compartments lined with mesothelium.[18] The main body cavity, under the crown of tentacles, is called the metacoelom, and the tentacles and their base share the mesocoelom.[9] Above the mouth is the epistome, a hollow lid which can close the mouth.[14] The cavity in the epistome is sometimes called the protocoelom, although other authors disagree that it is a coelom[19] and Ruppert, Fox and Barnes think it is built by a different process.
