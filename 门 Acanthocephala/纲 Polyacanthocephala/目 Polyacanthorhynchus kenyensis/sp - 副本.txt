It was first reported by Baylis (1928) but formally
described as Polyacanthorhynchus kenyensis by Schmidt
and Canaris (1967). That description was incomplete as it was
based on measurements of only 2 males because of the poor
quality of the few specimens available to the authors. Our larger
sample of good quality material obtained from Tilapia zilli,
Orechromis leucostictus, and Micropterus salmoides in Kenya
provided new information, making it necessary to emend the
description.

Emended description
General: With characters of the genus. Trunk and other shared structures
similar in size and shape in males and females except for slightly
larger proboscis receptacle in males and apical proboscis hooks in females,
and more cuticular trunk spines per circle in males than in
females. Trunk cylindrical with many small ovoid hypodermic nuclei;
main lacunar canals dorsal and ventral with regular lateral branches.
Trunk broadens slightly anteriorly into an armed part with parallel sides
bearing 9-12 circles of 18-32 cuticular spines each. Spines are decidedly
more numerous anteriorly than posteriorly where they are somewhat
larger, especially in females. Spines pierce through cuticular theca distally
and split proximally into 2-8 rootlike processes. Trunk stout and
much wider at middle but becomes gradually and significantly more
slenderp osteriorly,r esemblinga seahorse. Proboscis long, club-shaped,
with a proximalc onstrictiona nd anterioro void enlargementd; istal end
sparsely armed and terminating in a conically shaped projection containing
an apical organ with a duct and anterior opening. Apical structure
delineated internally with anterior insertion of 2 sets of strongp roboscis
retractorm uscles that pass posteriorly throught he proboscis receptacle
into the body cavity to insert dorsally and ventrally at the level of the
posterior end of the middle stout region of the trunk. Proboscis armed
with 21 or 22 regularly alternating longitudinal rows of 26 rooted hooks
each, throughout its length; hooks not differentiated dorsoventrally.
Apical hooks stout, with proximal half shoulder-like. Anterior hooks
often sleeved basally with cuticular outfoldings that may cover entire
shoulder of apical hooks. Postapical hooks stout and larger but become
progressively smaller and more slender posteriorly reaching smallest
size basally.Roots of all hooks simple and directed posteriorly,shorter
than blades apically, about equal in size medially, then shorter posteriorly,
and with anterior manubria basally.Neck insignificant P. roboscis
receptacle slightly longer than proboscis,single-walled,inserted at base
of proboscis, and with a brain near its middle at level of posteriormost
circle of cuticular spines. Lemnisci equal, large and wide, and about
twice as long as proboscis receptacle, extending to level of posterior
insertion of proboscis retractor muscles. Reproductive system poorly
developed and occupies narrow posterior end of trunk; genital pores
terminal.
